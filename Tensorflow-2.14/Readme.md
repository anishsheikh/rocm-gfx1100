the official branch of r2.14-rocm-enhanced has issues which lead to normal builds not work.
this is fixed in the release but issue persists in amd official repo. which im too lazy to report.
if you compile with this config build will pass and and you will get the wheel but it wont work on gfx1100 and gfx1030.

the problem is there for you to find out.
